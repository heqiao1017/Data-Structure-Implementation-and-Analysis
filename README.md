# Data-Structure-Implementation-and-Analysis
Demonstrate skill solving problems/programming with Data Types: C++ template classes, specifically the ICS46 Template Library, which includes the abstractions Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Set, Map (and eventually EquivalenceClass and Graph), including their iterators.
Demonstrate skill at using low-level C++ Data Structures (primarily arrays, self-referential linked structures, and combinations of these) to implement these Data Types correctly and efficiently.
Understand O (big oh), Ω (big Omega), and Θ (big Theta) notation, and demonstrate the ability to use these notations to analyze implementations of template classes (both analytically and empirically), and understand the usefulness and limits of these notations.
Understand C++ and general programming ideas that aid in 1-2: abstract classes, virtual functions, inheritance, recursion, hashing, caching, the decorator pattern, etc.
